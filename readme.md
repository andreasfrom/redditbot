RedditBot
---------
My bot for [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/).

Goes through a listing and posts the top Wordnik example of the longest word on
posts. Bad idea, but it was funny to make.
It's written in [Go](http://www.golang.org) and sticks to the
Reddit api limits. Bonus: it's full of constants :)

If you need an example on json.Unmarshal(), smtp.SendMail() or using the http
package, take a look at my code, and see if it helps.
