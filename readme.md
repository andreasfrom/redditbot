RedditBot
---------
My bot for [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/).

It posts [Wordnik](http://www.wordnik.com/) examples on posts. Bad idea, but it
was fun making it.
It's written in [Go](http://www.golang.org) and sticks to the
Reddit api limits. Bonus: it's full of constants :)

If you need an example on json.Unmarshal(), smtp.SendMail() or using the http
package, take a look at my code, and see if it helps.
